# data_augmentation

Data augmentation typically involves techniques to increase the diversity of your dataset without actually collecting new data. Common methods include adding noise, scaling, and altering some features. Here's how you might apply some basic data augmentation techniques to your DataFrame:
#### Adding Noise: Randomly perturbing numeric features.
#### Scaling: Slightly increasing or decreasing numeric features by a small percentage.
#### Random Sampling: Creating synthetic samples based on existing data.
